#### Known issues

Please feel free to help out with these :)

1. The size text doesn't always align perfectly (vertically)

2. This packages uses the [cost-of-modules](https://cost-of-modules.herokuapp.com) api by [@pastelsky](https://github.com/pastelsky). It's hosted on a free heroku instance, might not always be able to support the traffic it gets :)
